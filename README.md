# Springboard

## **2. Programming in R**
> R is a programming language mainly designed for statistical analysis, and one of the most prominent languages in the data science world. In this module, you’ll first learn R through an in-browser, interactive series of exercises. After that, you’ll learn to install R on your machine along with RStudio, a programming environment for R. Finally, you’ll learn to use R markdown to create documentation, and use github as a code repository.
> Together, this set of tools is an authentic representation of what you might be using day-to-day in a data scientist industry role.

> - ###    8 Project: Submit Your Capstone Project Proposal

        Finalize one Capstone idea based on the feedback you got from mentor(s) and peers on your Section 1 submission, and also based on your newly acquired understanding of the R ecosystem. Think of the following questions:

        What is the problem you want to solve?

        Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldn’t have otherwise?

        What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?

        In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

        What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.

        **Submission Instructions:**

        Write a project proposal - a short (1-2 page) document written in R Markdown covering the questions above. 
        Create a github repository for your Capstone Project.
        Add this proposal to the github repository for your project. 
        Submit a link to this repository.
        Once your mentor has approved your proposal, please share the github repository URL on the community and ask for feedback.
