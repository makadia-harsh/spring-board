## **2. Programming in R** :-:- https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JQAsI2EDbp78gXzMKccnb94p-VevBvVK
> R is a programming language mainly designed for statistical analysis, and one of the most prominent languages in the data science world. In this module, you’ll first learn R through an in-browser, interactive series of exercises. After that, you’ll learn to install R on your machine along with RStudio, a programming environment for R. Finally, you’ll learn to use R markdown to create documentation, and use github as a code repository.
> Together, this set of tools is an authentic representation of what you might be using day-to-day in a data scientist industry role.
